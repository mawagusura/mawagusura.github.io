# Software ecodesign journey - from promises to business reality

Software ecodesign has been gaining traction in the recent years, along with Green & Sustainable IT and the realisation of the software industry that their everyday work actually had an impact on the environment. Nowadays, sustainable IT has become a whole business, and it's sometimes hard to get a grasp on what software ecodesign actually is, given the multiplicity of actors and the broad 

In this article, I wanna tell my journey with software ecodesign, and where I stand now.


# Backrgound

My personal story with software ecodesign dates back to my student days in university. Back then, I was still relatively new to IT, and was trying to read a lot on IT good practices in general. I started following blogs and people on social networks. I eventually came across an article talking about the environmental impact of IT product and services. 

This was news to me, I hadn't really thought about the physical externalities that the IT industry could have, and to my great surprise (at the time), i learnt that its impacts were far from negligeable : the sector is estimated to be responsible for ~2-4% of the global CO2eq emissions.

As a student in software engineering, and as a person committed to minimize my impact on the environment, I naturally started to read up on the topic. I built my own bibliography database (thanks to zotero and sci-hub), and once I had gained more knowledge, it became evident to me that we, as software developers, had to do something about it. I was working part-time for IBM at the time, and had previously had an internship in a medium-sized e-commerce french company. Never had I heard about potential impacts the code we were shipping could have, and resources on software ecodesign were scarced at the time.

# What is software ecodesign anyway ?

Ecodesign has been around for a while, and is a well-known objective and method to minimize the impact of a product or service on the environment in many industries. It's important here to remember that these impacts are not measured in MWh (quantity of electric energy consumed): electricity consumed during usage is not a final indicator. In order to get an holistic view on global impacts of a software product, we must take a step back and analyze it through all of its lifecycle, including all the dependencies required for this product to emerge (not talking about node_modules here!).
We measure environmental footprints by other KPIs : greenhouse gaz emissions, water consumption, abiotic resources consumption, contributions to acidification ...

Software ecodesign designates all the method and practices used to mitigate some of its footprints. 

# Early days

Back to my student days, the french resources were mainly centered around (greenit.fr)[https://greenit.fr], a media / working group (it's a bit more complex than that, but let's not deep into this now), and the green code lab.
These resources, while generally pretty good, were not necessarily easy to find and to use, and there wasn't any ready-to-use framework for companies to pick.

The green code lab wasn;t very active anymore when it came to editing resources, and greenit had a pretty weird governance, which made it pretty hard to get involved and help.

To tackle this, a group of people founded the sustainable IT institute [^1], a NGO focused on building knowledge, resources, gathering professionals, and influence the IT industry towards a greener future. I became a member, and jumped on the opportunity to contribute to building more resources for professionals to use.

# Volunteering


# Back down to reality

// Talk about the importance of functionality / utility
// Talk about importance of the end-goal and objective

# Joining smaller companies

// less time to focus on sustainability alone
// performance vs sustainable

# My take now


A few core principles

- ecodesign is useless if you work for an oil company
- use physical resources more efficiently, and minimise cost
- think twice about the feature set, and center around the core value proposition
- use automation and abstraction with care and discernment
- don't prioritize DX over everything else
